### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My username is firebadnofire (any/all pronouns), and I'm a beginner developer in Unity and very fond of Linux ðŸš€


### About Me

I've always been obsessed with computers and their inner workings, and I've decided to publicly document my growing skills in the inner workings part. I'm only a beginner, so most of my code will be awful. So don't put this in mission-critical stuff OK?

### What I'm Learning
Unity Game Development

I'm just getting started but I'm sure it will lead to something, as I have really been loving the learning experience

Bash Scripting

Automation has always made my life easier and the command line is a great place to start with simple automation

I may in the future begin some light Python development

### My Goals

My primary goal is to document my progress transparently. By sharing my successes, failures, and everything in between, I hope to not only track my own growth but also inspire fellow beginners who are taking their first steps into the world of programming. Learning can be challenging, but it's fun. `"Most good programmers do programming not because they expect to get paid or get adulation by the public, but because it is fun to program."` This is a quote from Linus Torvalds, creator of Linux, which I believe in.

Thank you for stopping by and being a part of my learning journey. Remember, every line of code written is a step toward mastery, and I'm determined to make each line count
